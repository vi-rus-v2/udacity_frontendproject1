            <p class="refer">This post is taken from my Quora answer on “How should I start preparing for Google Summer of Code 2018?”</p>
            <p>I did GSoC in 2016 and will probably be a mentor for GSoC 2017 so I feel apt to answer this question</p>

            <p><Strong>Step 1:</Strong>Get away from Windows. OSX is fine but Linux is the best.
                I myself realized this the hard way. So it was March 2016, and almost 15 days remained 
                for proposal submission deadline and I decided to attempt GSoC that time. I was on Windows 
                and was sure that it would be sufficient for my development needs but boy was I wrong.
                 Lots of development tools and technologies don’t run well on Windows and almost all 
                 of the organizations in GSoC code for Linux systems or servers. Therefore I realized 
                 that Linux was necessary for me to stand a chance and I dual-booted Ubuntu the next day.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Learn to love Linux. Okay the first two steps are not needed if you are 
              already enjoying Linux but for the general audience, this point is critical. Explore the command line,
               understand the file structure and try to appreciate the beauty that is Linux.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Become good in a programming language or domain. By domain,
               I mean backend (API) development, frontend development, Android development, Kernels .. and so on.
                Pick what you love the most and go explore the field. Find good projects on GitHub to contribute to 
                OR start your own project. Important is that you DO SOMETHING.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Find an organization. You should start searching for an org as early as Oct-Nov.
               Have a look at the previous year records to get a list of orgs that may come in the following year.
                Once you have the list, go to their GitHub page or related resource to learn more about their projects
                 and what they generally do. Make a list of orgs and projects that you find interesting. This all 
                 should happen before November or December.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Get Contributing! Decide the orgs and projects which you like the most and start 
              contributing to them. You may be scared as first as most of the orgs have strict guidelines that one needs to 
              follow to contribute to them, but be patient, read their docs, follow what is written and you will be fine.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Keep coding on till Feb-March 2018. By this time, the organizations list for GSoC 
              2018 will be announced along with the project ideas list. Use this information to trim out your target projects 
              list and start dedicated contribution to the filtered projects. You have a BIG positive chance if you have been 
              contributing to the org for some time.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>Once the proposals period opens, send in your proposal as soon as possible and request 
              feedback from the mentors. The more feedback you get, the better your application becomes and more the chances 
              you will get selected. Keep on contributing even after the proposal has been submitted. This will give a good impression 
              that you are a serious contributor to the org.</p>
            <p>So hey, this is my 7-step program for preparing and cracking next year’s GSoC. Prepare for GSoC with full
               dedication and rest assured, you will be able to qualify it. Google Summer of Code can be the turning point of your career 
               so I recommend that any aspirant shouldn’t take it lightly.</p>
            <p>That’s all for now.</p>
            <p>Cheers and Best of Luck.</p>
